This code is originally from https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera/
It was modified by infiray, and later by netman.

I'll try to explain the state of separate things here:
    libusb              - master at 4622bfcf44db373c53502e3fe873bd611e8332f6 (untouched)
    libuvc              - master at 15925fed1a08462965a2d24a585a0b0c41d6a9ef (untouched)

Before this it was:
    libusb              - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
    libuvc              - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
    InfiCam             - used to be UVCCamera dir, now rewritten entirly except Android.mk

The following have now been deleted:
    libjpeg-turbo-1.5.0 - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
        had to comment a line in Android.mk to make it build
    rapidjson           - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
    UVCCamera           - modified a lot from anything upstream

Short description of the C++ classes in jni dir:
    - UVCDevice     just a wrapper around libuvc, reason for it existing is that using libuvc with android gets pretty involved
    - InfiFrame     that's where i dumped everything to do with analyzing a frame as it comes out of the camera
    - InfiCam       connecting to the camera, feeding the frames to InifFrame class, etc
    - InfiCamJNI    whatever garbage is needed to glue InfiCam class to the Java end

classes.jar was replaced with a whole bunch of separate files from saki4510t/libcommon,
    some from the latest git version, but most from tag 5.7.0

TODO
    - 400 celcius range works quite badly because the float math falls apart below a certain temperature
    - the license headers have notes about other files that are no longer relevant (USBMonitor, some of the gradle stuff)
    - don't forget to reference/put saki license for libuvc_build and other if i put a licence/copying file in root
    - do I go with apache license for new files too? (almost everything in libinficam is new files already...)
    - apache license says i should put prominent notices that i changed stuff, i should
    - figure out where i want to go with the UI part
    - move the palette stuff into the java code
