This code is originally from https://github.com/saki4510t/UVCCamera/
It was modified by infiray, and later by netman.

I'll try to explain the state of separate things here:
    libusb              - master at 4622bfcf44db373c53502e3fe873bd611e8332f6 (untouched)
    libuvc              - master at 15925fed1a08462965a2d24a585a0b0c41d6a9ef (untouched)

Before this it was:
    libusb              - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
    libuvc              - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
    InfiCam             - used to be UVCCamera dir, now rewritten entirly except Android.mk

The following have now been deleted:
    libjpeg-turbo-1.5.0 - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
        had to comment a line in Android.mk to make it build
    rapidjson           - commit ebaf03a18b577852bd6dc2bd57cedef5a8eef59f of saki4510t/UVCCamera (copied in by netman)
    UVCCamera           - modified a lot from anything upstream

TODO
    - 400 celcius range works quite badly because the float math falls apart below a certain temperature
    - the license headers have notes about other files that are no longer relevant
    - do I go with apache license for new files too? (almost everything in libinficam is new files already...)
    - apache license says i should put prominent notices that i changed stuff, i should
    - figure out where i want to go with the UI part
